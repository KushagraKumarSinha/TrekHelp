# Overview of the Project

Trek-Help is an application that I built during a Hackathon. I used ReactJS for the frontend and Python for the backend. The project displays details of the 5 most popular trekking spots in Pennsylvania, which it gets for a SQL database using RESTful Apis. The application also has a chat feature that allows people at the same location to communicate.
